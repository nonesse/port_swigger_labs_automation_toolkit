## SQL Injection Scripts

### üöÄ How to use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nonesse/port_swigger_labs_automation_toolkit.git
   ```

2. Move to the `sqli` folder:
    ```bash
    cd sqli
    ```

3. Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Adapt the `url` variable inside the script you intend to use.  
   This is necessary because each PortSwigger lab generates a unique URL per user/session.

5. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python3 script_name.py
    ```
